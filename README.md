# MSML603_Project2

The aim of this project is to classify two sets of image data using neural networks. The MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 images of handwritten digits, will be used as a benchmark on which to compare the results obtained on the POSE dataset, made up of images of the faces of 68 subjects. In a previous project conducted using the POSE dataset, best results were achieved using a Bayes classification model which was able to classify the images with 74% accuracy in testing. The goal of this project will be to produce better results than the Bayes classifier on the POSE image data.
